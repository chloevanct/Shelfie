# My Personal Project: Shelfie

## *Remember* what you have, be *eco-friendly* with *Shelfie*  

#### Feel inclined to stock up on products during an amazing sale?
#### Find something you forgot you had only to discover it’s now expired?  
#### Forget when you opened a product and wonder if and when it expires?

Many individuals, like myself, struggle with this problem. 
Whether it’s from over-stimulation and buying all that you can abroad (*K-beauty I’m talking about you*), 
the satisfaction of saving a few dollars during semi-annual sales (**... Sephora**), or succumbing to a trend on TikTok, 
the end often results in wasted resources: product and money.

**Thankfully**, this application is here to give structure. 
This application applies to skin-care and make-up products, so it appeals to any enthusiast. 

This app allows one to:
- Keep track of skincare and cosmetics
- Organize by brand, type, expiry date, first open date
- Provides visual reminders for expired or soiled products
- Tracks product life based on first-open date and manufacturer’s label
- Provides statistics on usage trends 

### On a more personal note -
This problem domain grew from my challenges with skin conditions. I constantly suffered from small
bumps, acne and scarring which made me very self-conscious growing up. Realizing and now, abiding to make-up 
cleanliness and after-opening expiry dates has cleared my skin dramatically. This is significant as bacteria 
and other microbes start to overcome preservatives by a certain period of time. If products are used beyond 
this time, it can commonly trigger skin conditions such as acne, redness and bumps. 
Following this principle over the past 4 years has brought light to my overconsumption (for reasons above), when
unopened and barely used products are often thrown away. Swept into the ebb and flow of trends in addition to 
"out of sight, out of mind" behaviours, it is estimated that I could have saved at least a thousand dollars in the
past 4 years. It makes me feel guilty thinking about what better value I could have gotten from saving or
spending elsewhere.


**To summarize**, I hope this application helps anyone with their skin, spending and confidence. At a higher level, 
I hope this application helps you be more **sustainable**.
