# My Personal Project: Shelfie

## *Remember* what you have, be *eco-friendly* with *Shelfie*  

#### Feel inclined to stock up on products during an amazing sale?
#### Find something you forgot you had only to discover it’s now expired?  
#### Forget when you opened a product and wonder if and when it expires?

Many individuals, like myself, struggle with this problem. 
Whether it’s from an overstimulating frenzy during overseas travels (*K-beauty I’m talking about you*), 
the satisfaction of saving a few dollars during semi-annual sales (**... Sephora**), or succumbing to a trend on TikTok, 
the end often results in wasted resources: product and money.

**Thankfully**, this application is here to give structure. 
This application applies to skin-care and make-up products, so it appeals to any enthusiast. 

This app allows one to:
- Keep track of your skincare and cosmetics (roster with picture)
- Organize by type, date purchased, expiry date, date you first opened
- Provides visual reminders for expired or soiled products
- Tracks product life based on first-open date and manufacturer’s label
- Provides statistics on usage trends 

### On a more personal note -
Additionally, this application targets issues that started with my strong desire to find the cause of small bumps, 
acne and rough skin texture which made my self-esteem low growing up as a young adult.
Recognizing and abiding to after-opening expiry dates has cleared my skin dramatically. 
After a certain time the water in products promotes bacterial growth and is a common issue for many skin conditions 
such as acne, redness and bumps. By following this principle over the past 4 years my overconsumption has caused waste 
that cost me over a thousand dollars on unopened and barely used products. I got swept into the ebb and flow of trends 
that I often forgot about what I have. Each moment I throw an item away I feel immense guilt for the waste of resources.
I think about what better use I could have spent my money on and what useful value it could have provided me.

**To summarize**, I hope this application helps anyone with their skin, spending and confidence. At a higher level, 
I hope this application helps you be more **sustainable**.
