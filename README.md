#### Feel inclined to stock up on products during an amazing sale?
#### Find something you forgot you had only to discover it’s now expired?  
#### Forget when you opened a product and wonder if and when it expires?

Many individuals, like myself, struggle with this problem. 
Whether it’s from overstimulation and buying all that you can abroad (*K-beauty I’m talking about you*), 
the satisfaction of saving a few dollars during semi-annual sales (**... Sephora**), or succumbing to a trend on TikTok, 
the end often results in wasted resources: product and money.

**Thankfully**, this application is here to give structure. 
This application applies to skin-care and make-up products, so it appeals to any enthusiast. 

This app allows one to:
- Keep track of skincare and cosmetics
- Organize by brand, type, expiry date, first open date
- Provides visual reminders for expired or soiled products
- Tracks product life based on first-open date and manufacturer’s label
- Provides statistics on usage trends 

### On a more personal note -
This problem domain grew from my challenges with skin conditions from high school. I constantly suffered from small
bumps, acne and scarring which made me very self-conscious growing up. Recognizing and abiding to make-up cleanliness
and after-opening expiry dates has cleared my skin dramatically. Beyond a finite time bacteria and other microbes start 
to form in products which is a common trigger for many skin conditions such as 
acne and bumps. By following this principle over the past 4 years my overconsumption (for reasons above) has caused 
waste that cost me over a thousand dollars on unopened and barely used products. I got swept into the ebb and flows of 
trends that I often forgot about what I already have. Every moment I throw an item away I feel immense guilt for the 
waste of resources. I think about what better use I could have spent my money on and what useful value 
it could have provided me.


**To summarize**, I hope this application helps anyone with their skin, spending and confidence. At a higher level, 
I hope this application helps you be more **sustainable**.
